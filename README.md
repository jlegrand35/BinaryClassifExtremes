# Evaluation of binary classifiers for asymptotically dependent and independent extremes

Reproducible materials for _Evaluation of binary classifiers for asymptotically dependent and independent extremes_ 

Five different code files are provided. 

* `functions.R`: contains the functions used to compute the empirical risk estimator, the optimal linear classifier and the statistical test (see Appendix C). A complete description of the functions is provided    
* `simulation_codes.R`: contains the codes to reproduce the simulation part (Section 3 and Appendix C)     
* `application_codes.R`: contains the codes to reproduce the application part (Section 4 and Appendix C)     
* `application_linear_codes.R`: contains the codes to reproduce the application part from Appendix E    
* `examples_codes.R`: contains simple reproducible codes using the empirical risk estimator function
